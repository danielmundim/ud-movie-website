- media is the file containing the movie class and methods that are required to support the application.
- fresh_tomatoes is the file that is called upon to create the html page, it has the "open_movies_page" method that takes a movie list as argument, it receives the list of movies from the "movies_main.py" file and based on that creates the page showing the movies.
